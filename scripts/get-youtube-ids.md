# How to Get YouTube Video IDs

## Option 1: From Playlist URL (Easiest)

1. Go to your YouTube playlist
2. Copy the playlist URL (looks like: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxxxx`)
3. The playlist ID is the part after `list=`

**Example:**
- URL: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7HfhnqHyzRmGDUMDhcSgZW8pR7DhW_Hl`
- Playlist ID: `PL7HfhnqHyzRmGDUMDhcSgZW8pR7DhW_Hl`

## Option 2: Get Individual Video IDs

### Method A: From Video URL
1. Click on a video in your playlist
2. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx&list=PLxxxxx`)
3. The video ID is the part after `v=`

**Example:**
- URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=PL7HfhnqHyzRmGDUMDhcSgZW8pR7DhW_Hl`
- Video ID: `dQw4w9WgXcQ`

### Method B: From Playlist Page
1. Open your playlist
2. Right-click on each video → "Copy video URL"
3. Extract the video ID from each URL

## Option 3: Use YouTube API (Advanced)

If you want to automate this, I can create a script that fetches all video IDs from your playlist automatically.

## What I Need From You

Please provide:
1. **Playlist URL** - The full YouTube playlist link
2. **First 5 video titles** - So I can match them correctly
3. **Or** - Just tell me the playlist URL and I'll help extract everything

Once you share the playlist URL, I can:
- Extract the playlist ID
- Get all video IDs in order
- Update the course page automatically
