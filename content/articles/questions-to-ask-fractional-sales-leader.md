### **Key Takeaways:**

* Hiring a Fractional Sales Leader requires vetting for stage-relevant experience, daily availability, and a structured audit process
* Industry experience matters far less than operational competence in the $1M–$10M ARR range
* The right candidate describes pipeline stages and CAC baselines, not "brand alignment" or "corporate synergy"
* A high-quality leader will promise a 30/60/90 day roadmap before making any changes

## What is a Fractional Sales Leader?

A Fractional Sales Leader is an experienced executive who takes ownership of the sales function for a company on a part-time, contract basis. Unlike a consultant who only advises, a Fractional Sales Leader is an operator who builds strategy, manages the team, installs infrastructure (CRM, playbooks), and is accountable for revenue targets, typically for businesses between $1M and $10M in ARR.

## The Founder's Dilemma: Hiring for Impact, Not Just Advice

You are at a revenue plateau. You have reached $2M or $5M in ARR through sheer force of will, founder-led sales, and perhaps a few early hires. But the system is breaking. You are the bottleneck.

You know you need senior leadership, but a full-time VP of Sales commands a $250k+ base salary plus equity—a risk your P&L might not be ready to absorb. The logical bridge is a Fractional Sales Leader.

However, the "fractional" market is noisy. It is filled with consultants who want to give advice from the sidelines and retired executives looking for a low-stress retirement gig. **You do not need advice; you need Revenue Operations installed and a team to be managed.**

To distinguish between a high-impact operator and a passive advisor, you need to ask the right questions during the interview process. Here is the framework.

![The 3 Critical Questions Vetting Framework](/images/articles/questions-vetting-framework.png)
*The three questions that separate operators from advisors.*

---

## Question 1: "Have you done this before for a company of our size?"

**The Trap:** Founders often obsess over industry experience ("Have you sold SaaS to dentists before?"). This is a mistake.

**The Reality:** At the $1M–$10M stage, sales problems are structural, not vertical-specific. A sales process for a $5M manufacturing firm has more in common with a $5M software firm than a $5M software firm has with Salesforce.

**What you are looking for:** You need Stage-Relevant Experience. You need someone who has taken a chaotic, founder-dependent environment and built a Sales Playbook from scratch.

Ask them to describe a specific scenario where they entered a company with:

* No defined sales stages.
* A CRM that was essentially a digital Rolodex.
* Reps who were "winging it" on every call.

If they start talking about "brand alignment" or "corporate synergy," run. If they talk about defining entry/exit criteria for pipeline stages, establishing CAC:LTV baselines, and implementing a daily standup rhythm, you have found an operator.

> **The "Red Flag" Answer:** "I ran a division of 500 reps at Oracle." Great, but that person has likely forgotten how to build a comp plan or configure a HubSpot pipeline. You need a builder, not a maintainer.

## Question 2: "How much time will you spend with our sales team?"

**The Trap:** Assuming "Fractional" means "Hands-off."

**The Reality:** Sales is a high-frequency, high-emotion activity. Deals die in hours, not weeks. If your leader is only available for a one-hour strategy call on Fridays, your team will starve for direction.

**What you are looking for:** You need Daily Availability, even if the hours are limited. A Fractional Sales Leader might only be contracted for 10 hours a week, but those hours must be deployed effectively.

**The Operational Rhythm:** A competent Fractional Leader should describe a rhythm that looks like this:

* **Daily:** Available via Slack/Teams for urgent deal triage.
* **Weekly:** Running the Monday pipeline review and Friday training session.
* **Monthly:** Deep-dive metric analysis (conversion rates, Pipeline Velocity).

![Operational Rhythm: Daily, Weekly, Monthly Cadence](/images/articles/questions-operational-rhythm.png)
*The cadence of effective fractional leadership: embedded at every level.*

They must be embedded in the communication flow. If a rep hangs up the phone after a tough objection, they need to be able to ping their leader for immediate feedback. If the leader is "unavailable" until next week, the learning moment is lost.

> **The "Red Flag" Answer:** "I check in once a week to review the numbers." That is a dashboard monitor, not a sales manager. You can check the numbers yourself. You are paying for active management and coaching.

---

## Question 3: "How will you know where to start?"

**The Trap:** Hiring a leader who brings a "plug-and-play" playbook without diagnosing your specific bottlenecks.

**The Reality:** Prescription without diagnosis is malpractice. Every sales organization is broken in its own unique way. One might have a lead generation problem; another might have a closing problem; another might have a CRM Hygiene disaster.

**What you are looking for:** A structured Sales Audit followed by a 90-day Action Plan.

Before they change a single thing, a high-quality candidate will want to:

* **Interview the team:** Understand the culture and skill gaps.
* **Audit the CRM:** Look at historical data, win/loss ratios, and data integrity.
* **Shadow calls:** Listen to actual sales conversations to hear the "voice of the customer."

**The Deliverable:** They should promise you a roadmap. For example: "First 30 days we fix the CRM and define the stages. Days 30-60 we implement the new script and train. Days 60-90 we hire two new SDRs."

If they cannot articulate how they diagnose problems, they will likely waste the first three months throwing spaghetti at the wall.

> **The "Red Flag" Answer:** "I'll just come in and shake things up immediately." Chaos added to chaos does not equal order.

## Why This Matters: The Cost of Getting It Wrong

Hiring a Fractional Sales Leader is a strategic investment. It is often the first time a founder truly lets go of the revenue engine.

If you hire the wrong person, you lose more than just their retainer fee. You lose:

* **Time:** 3-6 months of lost growth.
* **Team Morale:** Good reps leave bad managers.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Competitors capture the market while you are rebooting.

By focusing on stage-relevant experience, daily availability, and a diagnostic approach, you filter out the consultants and find the partner who will actually build your revenue machine.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much does a Fractional Sales Leader cost compared to a VP?**

A: A Fractional Sales Leader typically costs $6,000–$12,000 per month depending on scope, whereas a full-time VP of Sales costs $250,000+ annually (salary + benefits + equity). The fractional model allows you to access VP-level talent for a fraction of the cost, reducing burn rate while you scale.

**Q: Can a Fractional Sales Leader manage my existing sales team?**

A: Yes. In fact, management is a core responsibility. They should run your weekly pipeline meetings, conduct 1:1 coaching sessions, and hold reps accountable to KPIs. They act as the direct manager, removing that burden from the founder's plate.

**Q: How long should I keep a Fractional Sales Leader before hiring full-time?**

A: Most engagements last 6 to 18 months. The goal is for the Fractional Leader to build the infrastructure (CRM, playbooks, hiring process) and grow revenue to a point where the company can justify and afford a full-time VP of Sales. Often, the Fractional Leader helps hire their full-time replacement.
