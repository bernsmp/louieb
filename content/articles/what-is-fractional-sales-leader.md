### **Key Takeaways:**

* Fractional Sales Leadership is an operational model where a senior sales executive leads your revenue function on a part-time, contract basis
* Unlike consultants who provide advice, a Fractional Sales Leader executes—they install infrastructure, build playbooks, and hire your team
* A fractional engagement typically costs $70k-$144k/year vs. $400k+ for a full-time VP
* The goal is to build the machine so you can eventually hire a VP to run it

## What is Fractional Sales Leadership?

Fractional Sales Leadership is an operational model where a senior sales executive leads a company's revenue function on a part-time, contract basis. Unlike consultants who provide advice, a Fractional Sales Leader executes. They install sales infrastructure, build or optimize the CRM, hire sales team members, and create the playbook necessary to transition a company out of founder-led sales. 

**This allows the business to access C-level experience and judgment at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire.**

## The $3M ARR Trap: The Founder as the Bottleneck

If you are reading this, you are likely the founder of a B2B company doing between $1M and $10M in ARR. You are also likely the best sales rep in the company.

This is the "Founder Trap." You built the product, you know the market, and you close the deals. But you cannot scale because you are trapped in the day-to-day grind of demos, follow-ups, and pipeline management. You know you need to hand this off, but the traditional options are flawed:

*The endless cycle that caps your growth: demos, follow-ups, pipeline, close, repeat.*

* **Promote a Junior Rep:** They lack the strategic experience to build a department.
* **Hire a Big-Ticket VP of Sales:** This costs $250k–$300k (plus equity). If they fail—and 70% of first VP hires do—you burn a massive hole in your runway and lose 12 months of growth.

There is a third path: **The Fractional Sales Leader.**

## Buying Experience, Not Hours

> "You get their experience, judgment, and systems, but you only pay for the slice of their time you need."

This distinction is critical. When you hire a full-time employee, you pay 40 hours a week for their presence. When you hire a Fractional Leader, you pay for outcomes and systems.

A fractional leader typically engages for 3–12 months to solve a specific problem: **Building the Sales Machine.**

![Building the Sales Machine: Playbook, Infrastructure, Team](/images/articles/what-is-fsl-sales-machine.png)
*The three gears of a scalable sales engine.*

Here is what that operational process looks like:

---

## 1. Codifying the "Founder Magic" into a Playbook

Most founders sell on instinct. You know what to say because you experienced the problem. You cannot hire sales reps until that instinct is turned into a process. 

A Fractional Leader extracts this knowledge and builds a **Sales Playbook**. This includes:

* Defining the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) with rigid constraints.
* Scripting the discovery call framework.
* Documenting the objection handling matrix.

---

## 2. Installing Infrastructure and RevOps

You cannot scale on spreadsheets. A Fractional Leader takes ownership of Revenue Operations (RevOps). We do not just tell you to use a CRM; we configure it.

* **Pipeline Hygiene:** Ensuring stages match reality (e.g., "Closed Won" vs. "Verbal Commit").
* **Forecasting:** Moving from "I think we will close this" to data-driven probability.
* **Tech Stack:** Selecting the right tools (HubSpot, Salesforce, outreach tools) without overspending.

## 3. Hiring and Onboarding the First Scalable Reps

Founders often hire reps who are "mini-me" versions of themselves. This usually fails. 

A Fractional Leader uses their network and experience to identify the right profile for your specific stage (e.g., a "Builder" rep, not a "Maintainer" rep). We manage the interviews, the vetting, and crucially, the ramp-up period.

## The Economics: Why It Makes Sense

Let's look at the math.

![The Economics: Option A vs Option B Cost Comparison](/images/articles/what-is-fsl-economics-comparison.png)
*Option A (Full-Time VP): ~$400K/year vs. Option B (Fractional Leader): ~$70K-$144K/year. You get the same level of seniority for 25% of the cost.*

**You get the same level of seniority—often higher, as fractional leaders have done this repeatedly across multiple companies—for 25% of the cost.** This creates capital efficiency, allowing you to allocate funds toward marketing or product development while the sales engine is being built.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When should I hire a Fractional Sales Leader instead of a VP?**

A: You should hire a Fractional Leader when you have product-market fit ($1M+ ARR) and need to build processes, but you are not yet ready to manage a team of 10+ reps. If you need to build the foundation, go Fractional. If you need to manage an existing large team, hire a VP.

**Q: How much time does a Fractional Sales Leader spend with my team?**

A: Typically, a fractional leader spends 10–20 hours per week focused on high-leverage activities: pipeline reviews, strategy sessions, process building, and interviewing. They don't always sit in every meeting; they attend the right meetings to drive velocity.

**Q: What happens when the engagement ends?**

A: The goal of a Fractional Leader is to make themselves obsolete. By the end of the engagement, you should have a documented playbook, a functioning CRM, and a performing sales team. Often, the Fractional Leader helps you hire their full-time replacement (a Sales Manager or VP) to run the machine they built.

## Stop Guessing. Start Scaling.

You don't need another sales book, and you don't need a bloated payroll. You need a system.

If you are ready to transition out of founder-led sales and want to install a proven revenue engine without the risk of a full-time executive hire, we should talk.
