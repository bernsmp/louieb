## Review

### Summary of Changes

**New Files Created:**

1. `/content/articles/why-promoting-top-sales-rep-to-manager-fails.md` - Article about why promoting top sales reps to management roles typically fails
2. `/content/articles/founder-burnout-calculator.md` - Article with calculator framework showing hidden costs of founder-led sales

**New Images Created (8 total):**

Article 6 - Promoting Top Rep:
- `promoting-top-rep-thumbnail.png` - Thumbnail showing success vs failure split
- `promoting-top-rep-150k-mistake.png` - 6-month failure timeline
- `promoting-top-rep-skills-comparison.png` - Sales skills vs management skills comparison
- `promoting-top-rep-infrastructure-first.png` - Correct sequence for building sales teams

Article 7 - Founder Burnout Calculator:
- `founder-burnout-calculator-thumbnail.png` - Burnout concept with hidden costs calculator
- `founder-burnout-hidden-costs.png` - 3 hidden cost categories visualization
- `founder-burnout-example-calc.png` - Sarah's example calculation breakdown
- `founder-burnout-transition-plan.png` - 6-month transition timeline

### Dependencies Added

None - used existing project dependencies.

### Image Generation

Images were generated using:
- OpenRouter API with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- API key retrieved from 1Password CLI

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables needed. Used 1Password CLI for API key management.

### Verification

- Both articles appear on `/articles` page with thumbnails
- Individual article pages load correctly
- All 8 images display properly in articles
- Content matches the source Word documents

### URLs

- Article 6: http://localhost:3001/articles/why-promoting-top-sales-rep-to-manager-fails
- Article 7: http://localhost:3001/articles/founder-burnout-calculator

### Known Limitations / Future Improvements

- Images are generated by AI and may need manual review/touch-up for brand consistency
- Images are in PNG format (~1MB each) - could be optimized to WebP for faster loading
- The "Founder Burnout Calculator" article links to a tool page that doesn't exist yet (`/tools/founder-burnout-calculator`)

# Previous Task: Individual Video Watch Pages

## Status: COMPLETED

## Goal
Create dedicated watch pages for each video (`/videos/[slug]`) so Google can index them properly. Currently all 4 videos are on `/videos` and Google reports "Video isn't on a watch page".

## Review

### Summary of Changes
- Added `slugify()`, `getAllVideoSlugs()`, `getAllVideosWithSlugs()`, and `getVideoBySlug()` functions to `lib/cms.ts`
- Created new individual video watch page at `/app/(site)/videos/[slug]/page.tsx` with:
  - Video as primary/hero content
  - VideoObject schema markup for Google indexing
  - Dynamic metadata (title, description, OpenGraph)
  - "More Videos" section linking to other videos
- Updated `/app/(site)/videos/page.tsx` to link to individual pages instead of YouTube
- Updated `sitemap.ts` to include individual video URLs

### New Video URLs
- `/videos/build-this-before-hiring-salespeople`
- `/videos/my-1st-sales-hire-mistake`
- `/videos/build-the-system-before-the-team`
- `/videos/the-secret-email-step-that-gets-replies`

### Files Modified
- `lib/cms.ts` - Added video helper functions
- `app/(site)/videos/page.tsx` - Updated links
- `app/(site)/sitemap.ts` - Added video routes

### Files Created
- `app/(site)/videos/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual video watch page

### No New Dependencies
No new packages added.

### No New Environment Variables
No new env vars needed.

### Known Limitations
- Video upload dates are hardcoded to "2025-11-23" - could be made dynamic if dates are stored in CMS
